# path-integration-memory
Memory modelling for insect path integration.

## Getting started
It is recommended to create a virtual Python environment:

    python3 -m venv venv

Activate it by sourcing its `activate` script:

    source venv/bin/activate

Install the required packages using Pip:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

For subsequent sessions only the sourcing step needs to be repeated:

    source venv/bin/activate
